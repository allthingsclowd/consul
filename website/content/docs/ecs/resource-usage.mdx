# Resource Usage

We ran performance tests on Consul on ECS to determine the resource usage of
the sidecar containers Consul on ECS injects along with the ACL controller.
[The architecture page](/docs/ecs/architecture) describes each Consul on ECS
component in depth.

We ran performance tests by deploying clusters of varying sizes and measuring
resource usage during conditions that stress Consul on ECS components. After
each iteration of performance testing, we recorded resource usages of each
component to determine worst-case scenario resource usage in a production
environment. During performance testing, we used ECS' minimum allowable CPU and memory
resources, 256 CPU shares and 512 MB of memory, to demonstrate that
Consul on ECS along with application containers can run on the smallest ECS
tasks. Here is the maximum resource usage we observed for each container:

| Container      | CPU | Memory |
| -------------- | --- | ------ |
| ACL Controller | 5%  | 43 MB  |
| Health Sync    | 6%  | 35 MB  |
| Consul Client  | 10% | 87 MB  |
| Envoy          | 18% | 55 MB  |

As shown above, Consul on ECSâ€™ containers use well under the minimum CPU and
memory limits for an ECS Task. `memory` and `cpu` can be passed into Mesh Init
if additional resources are necessary.
